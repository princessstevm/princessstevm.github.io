I write for purely narcissistic reasons. I don't feel that I've anything particularly noteworthy to say nor do I think highly of my writing ability but for me, at least, writing is the path of least resistance.

It's been made known to me that I'm something of a blabbermouth when it comes to written communication - that I write more than I read and that I've a tendency to flood group chats. It often seems like I don't really care about what others have to say and that replies are just a vehicle for me to self-indulge in more writing but this could not be further from the truth. The truth is that when I read what others have written, I do care; I look at it as if it were a piece of artwork. Of course, it likely has the quality of a toddler's magnum opus drawn in hand-me-down crayon but think of what that toddler's parents feel. To them, it's something special; they'll fold it up, lock it up and cherish it at childhood's end.

The key difference is that I'm not anyone's parent; why should I care what you have to say? The crux of it is that I've always considered writing to be a form of content creation, even when the purpose of it is simple communication. There's an sense of permanence when it comes to written word - what you say out loud will come and go but writing lingers, it's tangible. You won't remember saying "hello" on a wintry morning of '99 but maybe you'll find something to that effect on a old crumpled post-it note on the floor of your attic and think "hey, I wrote that!" So I do care what you have to say, even if I don't like or know you. Just like uncountable Rowling fans will line up for a short message on the cover of their not-first-edition books, I'm lining up for yours; I'm a fan of you.

I suppose that brings me back to why I write. I hold no hope that my words will bring me money. I hold no hope that my words will bring me fame. I like to think that if those were the cases, I'd put a considerable effort into actually learning how to write properly instead of continuing with my natural mishmash style. So really it comes down to the same reason that I appreciate others' writing, even if it's by a stranger in a newspaper - it feels productive, it feels like I'm making something and, of course, it feels fun and I'm lost in it once I start. I suppose there's potential for serendipity as well; it may come to be that future civilisations will stumble upon my musings and sift through them as a fun activity in ancient history so to them, I have this to say: "hello."

While I did say that I wasn't making an effort to improve my writing ability, perhaps that's not entirely true. I've much disdain for people who overindulge in "big" words. To me, it's a hallmark of the type of person who's not quite intelligent but tries to be; it's almost as criminal as using adverbs. A fairly good analogy is to think of words as paints. "Big" words are like premixed colours in that you can achieve a relatively specific meaning at the cost of originality on the part of the writer and imagination on the part of the reader. With a palette of basic colours, you can reach the same effect and beyond; I think it should be everyone's goal to find new ways of expressing an idea, even if it's the same idea. To that end, I'm always consciously trying to moderate my language. That's not to say I was ever guilty of using "big" words. If I ever did then it's been supressed deep into my subconscious. However, I've the nasty habit of being abrasive in my everyday speech so I'm looking to clean myself up.

I don't consider myself to be a particularly creative person. That's probably why I write film reviews rather than fiction like most aspiring writers. I also don't have the common desire to write a book. Of course, I wouldn't be able to resist if an outstanding idea strikes me but I'm not giving myself an ultimatum. It's not my goal to publish but it's my goal to one day have a goal.

Let's go back to talking film reviews. It's fairly easy to draw connections between literature - to find meaning where there perhaps is none. I know a lot of people try to do this with film and for the most part, I enjoy reading their reviews but I'm not fooling myself. I consider writing reviews to be mostly derivative. There's not a lot of room for originality or creativity so I treat it as a temporary endeavor. Films give me something to write about until I find my muse.
